Content entry: Welcome to <i>Academical!</i>
Conditions  entry.
Effects     entry.
GoToChoice  entry outside.

Content outside: Brad reaches the door of his advisor's office and pauses. He wipes the sweat from underneath his glasses and takes a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. Could he even come clean? Hoping he had the willpower for the impending conversation, he raises his hand to the door.
Speaker outside brad.
ChoiceLabel outside: Stand outside of Ned's office
GoToChoice outside bus.
GoToChoice outside grill.
GoToChoice outside play_off.
Effects outside.
Conditions outside.

Content bus: Brad hesitates outside of the door. He is already late. The bus had taken an extra thirty minutes to get to campus this morning, and now he doesn’t have enough time to prepare as much as he would have liked.
Speaker bus brad.
ChoiceLabel bus: Take a moment to reflect
GoToChoice bus enter.
Effects bus.
Conditions bus.

Content grill: Ned had a reputation for being passionate, but not unfair. He'd always been a bit tough on Brad, despite his outward kindness. He was sharp and was probably going to detect that Brad was hiding something. He should probably come clean about it: Ned will find out eventually. But… maybe he doesn’t need to. It's Ned's fault that the approval took so long to submit, and Brad is running out of time. Even if Ned did find out, he would understand, right…?
Speaker grill brad.
ChoiceLabel grill: Think about the meeting with Ned
GoToChoice grill enter.
GoToChoice grill lament.
Effects grill.
Conditions grill.

Content play_off: Brad knows it’s better to come clean about his mistake, but the delay had jeopardized his progress. He could lay this down carefully to Ned, and tell him that he was on track, without elaborating on what that meant. Brad grips the doorknob a little tighter and makes a decision: he’ll tell the truth, just not the whole truth.
Speaker play_off brad.
ChoiceLabel play_off: Think about playing off his mistake
GoToChoice play_off enter.
GoToChoice play_off lament.
Effects play_off.
Conditions play_off.

Content enter: Ned clearly hadn’t missed Brad’s late arrival. No more stalling. Brad squares his shoulders and shuts the door behind himself.
Speaker enter ned.

Content youre_late: "Ah, there you are!" Ned says cheerfully. "I was beginning to wonder if we'd canceled this week."

Content relief: 
	Ned seems like he's in a good mood. Maybe this will be easier than expected.
	
	Brad smiles and says, "Sorry for being late, Ned, you know those buses never run on time."
	
	Ned nods understandingly. 
	
	"You're right, they run on wheels," Ned answers with a grin. The tension in the room eases, and Brad feels relieved.
[end]
Speaker relief brad.
ChoiceLabel relief: Comment on the buses
GoToChoice relief remind.
Effects relief.
Conditions relief.

Content reflect: Brad found out pretty soon after arriving at the lab that he had not been Ned's first choice. Ned's pick ended up at another university, and Brad had received the acceptance notice. Brad sometimes wonders if he’d been accepted because Ned just needed to reach a quota. Ned was hard on Brad, had him double and triple check his data, show up early to their lab meetings (to curb his tendency to arrive late), and was quick to correct his spoken mistakes. He was a brilliant researcher and Brad valued his attention, when he received it.
Speaker reflect brad.
ChoiceLabel reflect: Reflect on Brad’s relationship with Ned
GoToChoice reflect remind.
Effects reflect.
Conditions reflect.

Content remind: Ned interrupts Brad's train of thought. "Remind me where you're at again? Were you able to start on those surveys yet?" He pauses, and with some emphasis adds "Or are we still sitting on them?" He glances at his stack of notes, possibly annoyed. "I think we had decided we wanted to interview the children as well as their parents, is that right?"
Speaker remind ned.
ChoiceLabel remind: Ned interrupts his train of thought
Effects remind: [now [PleasantriesOver e0001]]

Content lament: Brad dreaded the impending assumption that he hadn't gotten anything done this week. Sure, there had been weeks where he'd been more focused on his semi-pro hacky sack career, and Ned had noticed. But he'd been in the lab the past seven days! Surely this time he deserved some recognition.

Speaker overworked brad.

Speaker silence brad.
ChoiceLabel silence: Consider what to say
GoToChoice silence youre_late.
Effects silence.
Conditions silence.

Content subjects: Brad thinks about the participant surveys he had conducted over the past week. He had been so proud of his progress, even though he wasn't technically supposed to start yet. He managed to find a way around the IRB requirements and he is quite pleased with all that he accomplished despite the challenges. Perhaps he will get the grant he's gunning for after all.
Speaker subjects brad.
