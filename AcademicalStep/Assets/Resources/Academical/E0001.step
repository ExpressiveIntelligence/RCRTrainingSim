Conditions  entry.

GoToChoice  entry outside.

Content outside: Brad reaches the door of his advisor's office and pauses. He wipes the sweat from underneath his glasses and takes a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart. Could he even come clean? Hoping he had the willpower for the impending conversation, he raises his hand to the door.
Speaker outside brad.
ChoiceLabel outside: Stand outside of Ned's office
GoToChoice outside bus.
GoToChoice outside grill.
GoToChoice outside play_off.
Effects outside.
Conditions outside.

Content bus: Brad hesitates outside of the door. He is already late. The bus had taken an extra thirty minutes to get to campus this morning, and now he doesn’t have enough time to prepare as much as he would have liked.
Speaker bus brad.
ChoiceLabel bus: Take a moment to reflect
GoToChoice bus enter.
Effects bus: [set Thread = entry]
Conditions bus.

Content grill: Ned had a reputation for being passionate, but not unfair. He'd always been a bit tough on Brad, despite his outward kindness. He was sharp and was probably going to detect that Brad was hiding something. He should probably come clean about it: Ned will find out eventually. But… maybe he doesn’t need to. It's Ned's fault that the approval took so long to submit, and Brad is running out of time. Even if Ned did find out, he would understand, right…?
Speaker grill brad.
ChoiceLabel grill: Think about the meeting with Ned
GoToChoice grill enter.
GoToChoice grill lament.
Effects grill: [set Thread = entry]
Conditions grill.

Content play_off: Brad knows it’s better to come clean about his mistake, but the delay had jeopardized his progress. He could lay this down carefully to Ned, and tell him that he was on track, without elaborating on what that meant. Brad grips the doorknob a little tighter and makes a decision: he’ll tell the truth, just not the whole truth.
Speaker play_off brad.

	Brad smiles and says, "Sorry for being late, Ned, you know those buses never run on time."
	
	Ned nods understandingly. 
	
	"You're right, they run on wheels," Ned answers with a grin. The tension in the room eases, and Brad feels relieved.

Conditions relief.

Content reflect: Brad found out pretty soon after arriving at the lab that he had not been Ned's first choice. Ned's pick ended up at another university, and Brad had received the acceptance notice. Brad sometimes wonders if he’d been accepted because Ned just needed to reach a quota. Ned was hard on Brad, had him double and triple check his data, show up early to their lab meetings (to curb his tendency to arrive late), and was quick to correct his spoken mistakes. He was a brilliant researcher and Brad valued his attention, when he received it.

Content remind: Ned interrupts Brad's train of thought. "Remind me where you're at again? Were you able to start on those surveys yet?" He pauses, and with some emphasis adds "Or are we still sitting on them?" He glances at his stack of notes, possibly annoyed. "I think we had decided we wanted to interview the children as well as their parents, is that right?"

Content lament: Brad dreaded the impending assumption that he hadn't gotten anything done this week. Sure, there had been weeks where he'd been more focused on his semi-pro hacky sack career, and Ned had noticed. But he'd been in the lab the past seven days! Surely this time he deserved some recognition.

He managed to find a way around the IRB requirements and he is quite pleased with all that he accomplished despite the challenges. Perhaps he will get the grant he's gunning for after all.
