[remembered]
States that when the task is called, its results (arguments and text output) should be cached.  Subsequent calls should be unified with the remembered arguments; when a match is found the remembered text, if any, should be printed and the task should complete.
[fluent]
States that the task is a [predicate] and, additionally, can be updated using now.  Methods can still be declared for the predicate, in which case they behave as defaults.
[function]
For [fluents], states that the predicate has the additional property of being a function in the sense that its last argument is unique given its previous arguments.  This means that an update like [now [F 1 2]] will not only mark [F 1 2] as true, but mark any previous [F 1 ?] as false.
