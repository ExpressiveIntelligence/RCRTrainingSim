### This configures Step to be able to generate pronouns
### You don't need to touch this code.
###

###
### Stuff you can call from your code (you would use these in PrintPlotPoint):
###
### Mention ?x      (or just ?x)
### Prints ?x.  If it uses a pronoun, it will be he/she/they rather than him/her/them
###
### Obj ?x          (or just ?x/Obj)
### Prints ?x, but if it uses a pronoun, uses him/her/them rather than he/she/they
###
### Possessive ?x   (or just ?x/Possessive)
### Prints ?x's or his/her/their, as appropriate
###
### Plural ?x       (or just ?x/Plural)
### Tries to guess the plural of ?x and prints it.
###

### Using gendered pronouns (optional)
###
### By default the system will use they/their for all students.  If you want it to
### use gendered pronouns, add facts saying:
###
###     PreferredPronoun <student> <pronoun>
###
### where <student> is the student student you're specifying the pronoun for and
### <pronoun> is either he, she, or they.
###
### If you want to specify gendered pronouns, I would recommend you add these to
### Student.step.
