    Brad has always puzzled you in the smallest of ways. He's quick to joke, though he never laughs. He dresses like he's going to a sporting event in less than ideal situations -- another student in your group has referred to his style as 'nerdbro', whatever that means. His most surprising talent, however, is with the hacky sack. You've seen him do things with it that obviously took hours of practice, but it's baffling how anyone could be dedicated to something like that. Were he so diligent with his research agenda.

    More troublingly, he has a habit of procrastinating and occasionally seems out of place in your field. Really, though, he's not a horrible student, and he's always come through eventually on the projects he's worked on.
