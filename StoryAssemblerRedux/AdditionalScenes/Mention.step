# ###
# ### This configures Step to be able to generate pronouns
# ### You don't need to touch this code.
# ###

# ###
# ### Stuff you can call from your code (you would use these in PrintPlotPoint):
# ###
# ### Mention ?x      (or just ?x)
# ### Prints ?x.  If it uses a pronoun, it will be he/she/they rather than him/her/them
# ###
# ### Obj ?x          (or just ?x/Obj)
# ### Prints ?x, but if it uses a pronoun, uses him/her/them rather than he/she/they
# ###
# ### Possessive ?x   (or just ?x/Possessive)
# ### Prints ?x's or his/her/their, as appropriate
# ###
# ### Plural ?x       (or just ?x/Plural)
# ### Tries to guess the plural of ?x and prints it.
# ###

# ### Using gendered pronouns (optional)
# ###
# ### By default the system will use they/their for all students.  If you want it to
# ### use gendered pronouns, add facts saying:
# ###
# ###     PreferredPronoun <student> <pronoun>
# ###
# ### where <student> is the student student you're specifying the pronoun for and
# ### <pronoun> is either he, she, or they.
# ###
# ### If you want to specify gendered pronouns, I would recommend you add these to
# ### Student.step.
