Content entry: Welcome to StepAdemical!

GoToChoice  entry outside.

Content outside: Brad reached the door and grasped the handle, motioning to push it inwards. Then he halted, wiping sweat from underneath his glasses. He took a deep breath, trying to calm his racing heart before knocking on the door. This was the moment he had been anxious for all week. Would he come clean? But he was already late, too late to come up with a game plan. Hoping he had the wherewithall for the conversation, he put his hand on the door.

Content bus: Brad stood outside the professor's office, his hand still on the doornob. He took a moment to gather his thoughts. The unreliable public transportation in this town! Inexcusable really. But the frustration wasn't useful.
Speaker bus brad.
ChoiceLabel bus: Brad reflects on being late
GoToChoice bus enter.
Effects bus.
Conditions bus.
Reusable bus e0001.

Content grill: Brad knew that Ned had a reputation for being passionate, but not unfair. He'd always been a bit tough on Brad, despite his outward kindness. He was sharp and was probably going to detect that Brad had something to hide. The first thought of Brad's was to come clean, he's going to find out eventually. But the other side of him realized that he had a lot of control over this project, perhaps he could slip one through. It's Ned's fault after all that the approval took so long to submit.
Speaker grill brad.
ChoiceLabel grill: Brad reflects that Ned might grill him
GoToChoice grill enter.

Reusable grill e0001.

Content play_off: 
	He glanced at his reflection in the window; his face was flushed, glasses slightly askew, and hair tousled from stress. A deep inhale and slowly released exhale were meant to calm his nerves but only highlighted the laborious beating of his heart within his chest. He was late, and his mind was frantic, scurrying to come up with a plausible excuse. But his every thought was overwhelmed by the mistake he'd made. 
	
	Facing the facts, Brad considered coming clean. After all, every mistake was just a lesson in disguise. But then a rebellious thought sparked within him. This was his research, his work. The reality was that the delay had jeopardized his own progress. Surely he could lay this down carefully to Ned by telling him simply that he was on track, no need to dive too deeply into it. As Brad gripped the doorknob once more, he decided there and then - he would take control of the situation, even if it entailed ommitting some of the truth.

ChoiceLabel play_off: Brad considers playing off his mistake
GoToChoice play_off enter.

Effects play_off.
Conditions play_off.
Reusable play_off e0001.

Content enter: 
	Brad squared his shoulders, taking one last glance at his disheveled reflection, before stepping soundlessly into Professor Ned's office. Ned's office was well organized - memorabilia from past psychology forums, a dog toy in the shape of a brain, a few student papers and a desktop computer to his left.
	Ned, with his furrowed brow and piercing gaze, was waiting for him. His impunctual arrival clearly hadn't slipped his notice and the evident tension was etched on Brad's face. The surroundings seemed to blur as Brad approached Ned's desk. The words buzzed around his head in a chorusing cyclone, a mingling of honesty and calculated discretion. His heartbeat opened his mouth, ready to deliver his carefully constructed report. No more stalling. His research, his rules.

Content doubt: 
	Brad can't tell if he's being truthful or just relieving the tension. In either case, it catches him off guard. 
	
	"There was a problem with the buses..." Brad starts lamely, but then cuts himself off.

Reusable doubt e0001.

Content relief: 
	Maybe playing off his mistake might be the better option. After all, Ned seemed to be in a good mood and Brad didn't want to ruin that. Perhaps this will be easier than expected.
	
	Relief washes over Brad as he contemplates playing off his mistake.He smiles and says, "Yeah, those buses can be really unreliable sometimes. Sorry for being late, Ned."
	
	Ned nods understandingly, seemingly accepting Brad's explanation. The tension in the room eases slightly, and Brad feels a sense of relief.

Reusable relief e0001.

Content reflect: Brad found out pretty soon after arriving at the lab that he had not been Ned's first choice of student. Ned's pick ended up at another university, and Brad had recieved the acceptance notice. Brad sometimes wondered if letting him in instead was just a labor requirement. Ned was hard on Brad, had him double and triple check his data, show up early to their lab meetings (to curb his tendency to arrive late), and was quick to correct his spoken mistakes. He was a brilliant researcher and Brad valued his attention, when he recieved it.

Content remind: Ned interrupts Brad's thought. "Remind me where you're at again? Were you able to start on those surveys yet?" He paused and with some emphasis added "Or are we still sitting on them?" He glanced his stack of notes, and Brad couldn't be sure if was annoyed. Ned continues, "I think we had decided we wanted to interview the children as well as their parents, is that right?"
Speaker remind ned.
ChoiceLabel remind: Ned interrupts

Content lament: Brad dreaded the impending assumption that he hadn't gotten anything done this week. Sure there had been weeks where he'd been more focused on his semi-pro hacky sack career, and Ned had noticed. But he'd been in the lab the past seven days! Surely this time he deserved some recognition.

Content overworked: In reality, this was too much. Some of Brad's friends were in a lab that encouraged a four day work week. How can someone who was pretty okay being overworked still have a reputation of laziness?
Speaker overworked brad.

Content subjects: Brad's mind races, contemplating the participant surveys he had conducted over the past week. He had been so proud of his progress, even though he wasn't technically supposed to start yet. He managed to find a way around the IRB requirements and he is quite pleased with all that he accomplished despite the challenges. Perhaps he will get the grant he's gunning for after all.

Content stressed: The problem, thought Brad to himself, is that I'm too overwhelmed by everything there is to do. On top of pounding out the survey design, I have to conduct the surveys! Getting the IRB proposal took me weeks of late nights. There's just too much riding on this...

Content say_something: Brad decided that he should just speak to these insecurities. Getting it out might feel better. On the other hand, he's already made the progress. Why not push through and try to get into Ned's good graces? Surely all this progress will get him some points with his advisor.

Content exit_bad: 
	There isn't a great way to bring up the stress, rather than focusing on the negatives, let's focus on the work at hand instead... 
	
	Still, Brad felt a little defeated having made this decision. These thoughts will stay bottled up.
